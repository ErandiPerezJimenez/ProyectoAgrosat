## High-Level Summary

AgroSat Solutions combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, real-time IoT data, and NASA's Earth observation datasets to predict irrigation requirements and assess potential weather impacts on agriculture. By analyzing data from NASAâ€™s **IMERG** and **NLDAS Noah** systems, processed via the **Giovanni platform**, AgroSat provides accurate, localized forecasts and irrigation suggestions.

### Key Achievements
- **LSTM Neural Networks** for time-series analysis of climate data.
- Integration of **IoT Sensors** for real-time, location-based forecasts.
- Use of **NASA Giovanni datasets** to enhance predictions.
- Development of a **Flutter-based mobile app** to present farmers with actionable insights.
